# Brain Tumor Detection with Tensorflow CNN

Welcome to my Tensorflow CNN-based Brain Tumor Detection notebook. This notebook explores both augmented and unaugmented models to get insight into effective tumor detection. It includes everything from data preprocessing to CNN implementation, providing a thorough analysis of medical picture data.

This notebook uses a dataset with four classes, glioma_tumor, no_tumor, meningioma_tumor, and pituitary_tumor, supplied from Kaggle: [Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri).

### Tumor Types: 
- **Glioma Tumor:** Originates in glial cells, often malignant, causing seizures and cognitive impairments.
- **Meningioma Tumor:** Forms in the meninges, grows slowly, but can cause seizures and eye problems.
- **Pituitary Tumor:** Mostly benign, occurring in the pituitary gland, leading to hormonal imbalances and vision changes.

### Conclusion: 
Experiments with both augmented and unaugmented models showed competitive results, demonstrating a tradeoff between accuracy and computational complexity. More data collection, transfer learning, and exploring synthetic data generation methods can lead to further advances.
